# Funding_Dapp_Project

Smart Contract Fund-raising project that functions in a decentralized manner on the backend rather than using a bank/intermediary to handle the transfer of funds. Uses Ethereum testnet Ropsten for testing purposes and might be upgraded to mainnet in later edits of project.

This project is being jointly worked on by Cody Rhoten and myself. 


To get started, clone the repository on whatever platform you choose, open up the terminal/command prompt, run npm install and the package.json will provide the basic react node module. then type "cd react-funding-app" and run npm start to run the project on localhost:3000.
